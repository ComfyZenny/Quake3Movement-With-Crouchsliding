# Quake3Movement-With-Crouchsliding
Quake 3 movement in Godot with crouchsliding based off of Slash from Quake Champions (no time limit to slide)

Noticing some people click on this so I thought I should just put out a notice. This thing is OLD! Godot 3 with old gdscript, I believe 4.0 has a port feature these days but you should at least know that it's old.
